Predicting Credit Card Default.....at the touch of a button...Using Machine Learning

Due to rising financial crisis and shift in the economic balance, it has become necessary to be aware financially to avoid such catastrophes. Banks and Employment firms must be able to differentiate between those who would default on payment and those who don't. To enable that, We have created an application using supervised machine learning to train a model with credit default data to determine the probability and classification “default” vs “non-default”) of the user’s liability. 

The dataset comes from UC Irvine Machine Learning datasets. All monetary amounts are expressed in Dollars in 2005. We accepted this to be relevant for our model because 22% of accounts in the dataset show at least a 30 day default. cording to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling "nearly 26 percent of Americans admit they do not pay their (credit card) bills on time, including people who sometimes miss a payment altogether(2009)." 

----To run the Program:
1) Clone or download the program
2) Run or Execute run.sh file using cmd. You might need tools like Git for Windows, which I used for this project
3) Enter details in the opened webpage and click on submit
4) When page loads, the chance of defaulting is given along with class of default probability (low, medium, high)

** If on running you get Internal Server/Service error, it might be due to missing out on values or webpage template being inaccessible. Redownload the code to solve that problem
